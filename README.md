# binarytranslate
A simple python program and repository around it that translates simple characters into binary.

# Instructions:
1. Navigate to the folder in Git Bash. cd C:/folder/folder/binarytranslate
2. Run the file and add a character to the end: python main.py <character>
3. The program will print out the character's translation in binary, if it is in the system.


# How it works:
1. The sys module uses sys.argv to store your input on the command line in a variable called input
2. If the variable input's value is registered in the code, it will print out the translation in binary
3. If it is not, then a 'we're sorry' response will be given.
